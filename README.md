4) NameSpace Example: "PlayerControl" script ==> namespace IntermediateScripting 
5) Statics : in the beginnig of "PlayerControl" script.
6) Overloading: not done. (Using same name for functions, different signature)
7) Generics : GenericTesting objects and script works
8) Inheritance: not done. (Access modifiers public/protected/private ; like inherit from Monobehaviour.
9) Polymorphism : not done
10) MemberHiding: not done (Using same method/variable (between child and parent) 
				for different mission- with "new" identifier, opposite of overriding, 
				not commonly used)  
11)Overriding: not done (virtual /override) inheritance and polymorphism together; a method in child class, 
						can override a (virtual) method in parent class.

15) Attributes: are markers that can be placed above a class, [SerializeField], [HideInInspector],
		[ExecuteInEditMode], [Header("....")], [Range(x , y)] ....
16) List and Dictionaries .... 
17) Scriptable Objects done: "Enemy" object in hierarchy needs a scriptable object,
